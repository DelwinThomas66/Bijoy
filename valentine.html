                    <p data-text="Hey Anisha,"></p>
                    <p data-text="I've been meaning to write this, not because there's pressure or urgency, but because some feelings deserve to be said gently, while they're still honest and unforced."></p>
                    <p data-text="We've known of each other for years, crossed paths through a common friend, lived in that almost space for a long time. Back then, things didn't line up — not timing, not life, not space. And somehow, that makes what's happening now feel a little more meaningful."></p>
                    <p data-text="When we finally started talking properly, something felt easy. The jokes landed, the conversations flowed, and I didn't feel the need to edit myself. When we met, I was nervous — not because of awkwardness, but because I already cared a little. And then I realized there was no pretending on either side. You were exactly who you are — witty, thoughtful, sensitive in the quietest, strongest way. I was just me — jolly, teasing, comfortable."></p>
                    <p data-text="That comfort is what stayed with me."></p>
                    <p data-text="I like being around you. I like roasting you and being roasted back. I like how conversations with you don't feel forced or performative. There's a natural rhythm there — something calm, something warm, something that doesn't need constant reassurance to exist."></p>
                    <p data-text="I won't try to define this too neatly. I just want you to know that I feel the chemistry too, and I value what we're building. I like you — not in a loud, dramatic way — but in a way that feels steady, genuine, and full of curiosity about where this could go."></p>
                    <p data-text="No rush. Just honesty."></p>
